git add <file> - this will allow you to add files to be staged to be committed - note: you can use git add . to add all modified files
git commit -m - commit your changed files to your local repo that will eventually allow you to push to your remote repo. -m stands for message. Remmber to wrap your message in quatations ""

git push - allows you to push your commits to remote repo

git fetch allows you to view/grab commits/changes on your remote repo

git pull allows you to pull those changes to your local repo to be up to date locally
